# 3_Act_Analysis
This code loads student responses to two standardized instruments measuring student anxiety and confidence in mathematics. 
It also loads a spreadsheet containing hand-scored student performance on a pre- and post- test.
All analysis conducted in this file is presented in the paper "Modeling as a Means to Mitigate Disengagement:  The Effects of 
Modeling Based Math Curriculum on Chronically Disengaged Secondary Students" which is currently in review at the Journal for Research in 
Math Education.

Paper Abstract:
Three Act Math is a popular video anchor-based approach to implementing modeling based education.  This paper examines the impact 
of using Three Act Math in a classroom of students identified as chronically disengaged in the traditional academic environment.  
Students who display characteristics of disengagement, such as poor attendance, misbehavior, and low effort are at significantly 
higher risk of dropping out of high school than their peers.  We find that a curriculum centered around Three Act Math increases 
student persistence and successful application of the 8 Standards for Mathematical Practice.  Modeling based education supported
by the Three Act Math framework was not found to have a significant effect on student anxiety towards math or student confidence 
in mathematics.
